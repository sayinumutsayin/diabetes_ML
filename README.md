 Predicting diabetes, ML model evaluations 

# Problem:

# The development of a machine learning model that can predict whether individuals have diabetes or not is requested when the features are specified. Prior to building the model, the whole necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps are expected.

# The story of the dataset:

# The dataset is part of a large dataset maintained by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in the United States. It is used for a diabetes study conducted on Pima Indian women aged 21 and older, residing in Phoenix, the fifth-largest city in the state of Arizona. The target variable is indicated as "outcome," where 1 denotes a positive diabetes test result, and 0 denotes a negative result.
